## What is Enem: 

The National High School Exam (ENEM) is one of the most significant educational assessments in Brazil, playing a crucial role in access to higher education. Established in 1998 by the Ministry of Education (MEC), the ENEM was initially designed to evaluate students' performance at the end of their basic education. Today, its scores are widely used for admission to public and private universities, as well as for scholarship programs and student loan opportunities.

The exam consists of tests covering various areas of knowledge, including Humanities, Natural Sciences, Languages, and Mathematics, in addition to a Writing section. A unique aspect of the ENEM is its use of the Item Response Theory (IRT) in grading, which assigns weight to questions based on the consistency of the responses and the difficulty level. This approach makes the assessment fairer, measuring not only the candidate's knowledge but also their reasoning ability.

Beyond its educational significance, the ENEM serves as a tool for social inclusion, democratizing access to higher education in a country marked by regional and socioeconomic inequalities. This data analysis on the ENEM aims to explore the results of the candidates and their implications, offering insights into educational and social trends in Brazil.

##  Description and Objectives:
In this data analysis project, our focus was on the detailed exploration of the 2022 National High School Exam (ENEM) data. The central objective of this work was to clean, organize, and subsequently analyze this vast dataset. Using Jupyter Notebook as our working platform, we relied on a robust set of Python libraries, including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Geopandas, to conduct the various stages of the project.

The work was meticulously divided into two main phases: data cleaning and the analysis itself. The data cleaning phase was a considerable challenge, given the magnitude of the original dataset, which occupied about 7GB of space. Through advanced processing and optimization techniques, we significantly reduced the data size to approximately 100MB, greatly facilitating the subsequent stages of analysis. This process was not limited to size reduction; it also involved creating and assigning new values to variables, transforming columns, correcting inconsistencies, and other fundamental aspects of feature engineering. Each adjustment was crucial to ensure that the data was clean, organized, and ready for analysis.

In the analysis phase, our goal was to investigate socioeconomic and demographic issues that might be related to the performance of candidates in the ENEM. Instead of developing predictive models, we chose to focus our efforts on creating informative and intuitive data visualizations. The purpose was to interpret these visualizations to identify patterns and trends that could offer insights into the factors that enhance or limit student performance in the exam. The analysis was based on data exploration and the interpretation of generated graphs, aiming to propose ideas and well-founded reflections that could contribute to a better understanding of the educational challenges in Brazil.

This project represents a deep and careful exploration of a vast and complex dataset, with the goal of shedding light on the socioeconomic and demographic dynamics that influence student performance in the ENEM.
